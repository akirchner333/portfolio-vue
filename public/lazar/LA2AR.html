						<div class="words">"According to all known laws of aviation, there is
							no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its
							fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because
							bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow,
							black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake
							it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second.
							Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't.
							I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good
							money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very
							proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got
							a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! -
							Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop
							flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A
							little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days
							grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days
							college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did
							come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks
							good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No,
							I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it
							on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of
							the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
							That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under
							the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. -
							Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome
							Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15.
							That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex
							Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation.
							Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at
							all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to
							Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is
							it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to
							get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins
							when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our
							top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and
							bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive
							golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my
							cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At
							Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
							These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you
							think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the
							Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that
							hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the
							Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that
							every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully
							because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The
							same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the
							difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had
							one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll
							sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! "What's the difference?" How can you
							say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm
							relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how
							could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything?
							We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You
							ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me
							one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please
							clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it
							out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this
							close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't
							come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're
							monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they
							were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying
							who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a
							Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more
							pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol.
							Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the
							ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?
							Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's
							have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once
							a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and
							with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd
							knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the
							authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,
							wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six
							miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for
							us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're
							going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I
							might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you
							surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a
							lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the
							same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that
							stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get
							yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I
							think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were
							thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy
							with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! -
							Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're
							not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna
							be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I
							have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
							Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave
							my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call
							everybody "dawg"! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's
							the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen
							counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is
							it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours!
							Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out.
							Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
							Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's
							available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. -
							Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the
							Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up
							again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead.
							Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck
							up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating,
							cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven,
							lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you
							think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch
							in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going
							out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to
							work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
							Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli
							on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't
							that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
							It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
							Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain
							advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be
							careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears
							and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on
							us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's
							awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely
							no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz,
							buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow!
							Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind,
							check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. -
							Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move
							it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you,
							drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I
							feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We
							have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30
							degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a
							bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up
							close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here.
							Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little
							bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power.
							More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm
							picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need
							those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the
							move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was
							on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm
							loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it.
							Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet
							lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could
							be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are
							way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I
							don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he
							knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey,
							because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car!
							- Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going
							to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
							He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension
							level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain.
							Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
							Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window
							please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You
							see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that?
							Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This...
							Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special
							skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars?
							Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't
							talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview,
							they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe
							that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I
							predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I
							thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter
							boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing
							could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does
							his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just
							saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
							My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an
							allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could
							puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is
							also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week?
							Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob
							chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta
							say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here
							it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a
							bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm
							doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it.
							I can't. How should I start it? "You like jazz?" No, that's no good.
							Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes,
							I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know
							I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is
							very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a
							bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all
							trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's
							just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a
							bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just
							want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to
							do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. "Mama,
							Dada, honey." You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are
							funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
							Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I
							mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no
							trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. -
							Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum
							cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying
							to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You
							look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all
							right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.
							He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The
							wedding is on. And he says, "Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan.
							Why would I marry a watermelon?" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of
							stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About
							work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it
							the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents
							wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. -
							Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected
							with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive
							right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the
							Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. -
							Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a
							hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh,
							yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great.
							Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish
							it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a
							piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All
							right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And
							thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing.
							Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all
							set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds
							amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my
							life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans!
							What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy
							giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? -
							Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle.
							You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had
							your "experience." Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well...
							- Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your
							parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not
							attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs
							and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No,
							no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's
							Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're
							dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the
							hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and
							M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she
							understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that?
							- They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not
							what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a
							Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it
							up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're
							us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is
							yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have
							got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. -
							Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
							There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I
							gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been
							three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions
							to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're
							barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out.
							Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm
							talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll
							catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I
							told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why
							yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this.
							Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A
							girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They
							have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the
							Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float,
							surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses
							compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you
							don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere?
							It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can
							just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo,
							but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb
							bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's
							usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully.
							You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out.
							Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my
							goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug.
							He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A
							Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like
							about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got
							that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet.
							What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here?
							Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor?
							- I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it.
							You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get
							it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!
							There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! -
							It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees
							don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've
							taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on
							sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of
							all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I
							sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey
							out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard
							something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking!
							Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't
							understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is
							upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the
							wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is
							the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey
							Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces,
							they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere!
							Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe
							anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto
							something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff.
							Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is
							dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple
							blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does
							everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to
							see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in
							Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose
							blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming.
							Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey
							jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck
							goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang
							tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We
							on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? -
							You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a
							mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet
							girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.
							Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me!
							Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! -
							Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy
							straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much
							pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a
							pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh,
							sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a
							minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple
							breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make
							the money. "They make the honey, and we make the money"? Oh, my! What's
							going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're
							in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no
							choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a
							drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey.
							Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse
							than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry,
							stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these
							look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously
							doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to
							humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And
							they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose
							side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those
							crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do
							with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder
							than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were
							still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they
							have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm
							for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting
							them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. -
							No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting
							the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only
							full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the
							anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And
							Jeanette Ohung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette
							Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for
							stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!
							Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in
							our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on
							Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, "I'm
							a kid from the hive. I can't do this"? Bees have never been afraid to
							change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where
							I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy
							stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this
							case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a
							Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He
							looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next
							week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you
							just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.
							Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In
							tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken.
							She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of
							that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same
							bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello,
							bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a
							half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better
							go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night!
							Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have
							been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. -
							Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the
							competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it
							takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving
							balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial
							flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent
							stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things!
							Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could
							make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I
							guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done
							with the humans, they won't be able to say, "Honey, I'm home," without
							paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan,
							where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history,
							we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have
							we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe
							how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar
							multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay
							behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a
							chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise!
							The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475,
							Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is
							now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food
							companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing
							all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to
							proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and
							gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a
							farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty
							of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr.
							Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to
							negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee!
							How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic
							motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser
							beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could be on
							steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here.
							I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important
							to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our
							lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they
							can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after
							this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only
							take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like
							that all the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss
							Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see
							you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for
						our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very"</div>
